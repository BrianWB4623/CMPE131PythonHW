One Reason Inheritance would be that way you can extend upon or override functions without completely rewriting them,
for example, when working with a class such as Vehicles, You could have a basic drive function that jsut moves forward, But
in a Car class, this function could also have press on gas pedal, or a bike class could have rotate pedals with force to drive

Another reason to use inheritance would be so you dont have to define something over and over, for the same vehicle example
you could have multiple types of vehicles, that are all using the Vehicle class to get basic attributes such as color, length, weight, etc
